    Crossing problem statement</a>
</p>
    
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p> Next we must constrain each consecutive pair of constraints to
    abide by the transition function. If the farmer is on the near
    side of the river, then the near side of the river is the 'from'
    side and the far side of the river is the 'to' side. And if the
    farmer is on the far side, then the far side is 'from' and the
    near side 'to'. We express this constraint in the following Alloy
    fact.
</p>

<b><pre>
1. fact stateTransition {
2.   all s: State, s': next(s) {
3.     Farmer in s.near =>
4. crossRiver(s.near, s'.near, s.far, s'.far),
5.       crossRiver(s.far, s'.far, s.near, s'.near)
6.   }
7. }
</pre></b>

<p> The function <b><tt>OrdNext</b></tt> in the above fact is provide
    by the <b><tt>std/ord</b></tt> module. It returns the state that
    follows it's argument in the linear ordering. That is,
    <b><tt>OrdNext(s)</b></tt> returns the state immediately following
    <b><tt>s</b></tt>; unless <b><tt>s</b></tt> is the last state in
    the linear order, in which case it returns the empty set. So the
    quantifying expression "<b><tt>all s: State, s':
    OrdNext(s)</b></tt>" effectively says "for all consecutive pairs
    of states". It is equivalent to writing "<b><tt>all s, s': State |
    s' = OrdNext(s) => ...</b></tt>".
</p>

<p> Here we see <b><tt>=></b></tt> followed by two expressions
    (separated by a comma) used to denote a conditional (if-then-else)
    <a href="sidenote-logic-ops.html" target="sidenote"> logical
    operation</a>.
</p>

<p> Now that our state machine is defined, we must ask Alloy to
    produce a trace of the state machine in which all the objects are
    on the far side of the river in the final state. To do so, we
    first construct a function whose solution to which will be such a
    trace.
</p>

<b><pre>
1. pred solvePuzzle () {
2.      last().far = Object
3. }
</pre></b>

<p> Recall that <b><tt>Object</b></tt> is just a set and can be read
    as "the set of all Objects".  That is, we are saying that, in the
    last State, the set of things on the far shore equals the set of
    all things.  This is a place where the rough OO level
    understanding of Alloy will mislead you (that is, thinking of
    <b><tt>Object</b></tt> as a class), and a set theoric level of
    understanding is required to make sense of the model.  (Recall our
    earlier discussion of <a
    href="sidenote-levels-of-understanding.html"
    target="sidenote">three levels of abstractness</a> for
    interpreting an Alloy model</a>.)
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> Finally, we add a command to our model--"<b><tt>run solvePuzzle
    for 8 State expect 1</b></tt>"--and execute the command. Notice
    that we don't need to specify the scope for, say,
    <b><tt>Farmer</tt></b>; that scope is implicit because we marked
    the signature <b><tt>one</tt></b>.</p>

<p> Not surprisingly, Alloy finds no solutions, because the problem
    can't be solved in only two states. If we steadily increase the
    scope on the set of States, we eventually reach a point at which
    Alloy can find a solution at a scope of 8. Thus, the command that
    finds the smallest solution to this puzzle is
</p>

<b><pre>
1. run solvePuzzle for 8 State expect 1
</pre></b>

<p> By saying <b><tt>expect 1</tt></b>, we tell the analyzer that we
    are expecting there to be a solution.  This is useful for
    regression tests, to make sure that old models maintain the same
    behavior.</p>


<!--
<p> Of course (just as the the <b><tt>run</b></tt> command in Chapter
    1), there are several equivalent <a
    href="sidenote-alternative-run-solvepuzzle.html"
    target="sidenote"> alternatives for specifying this scope </a>.
</p>
