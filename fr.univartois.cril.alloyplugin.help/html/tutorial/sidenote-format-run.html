    <h2>Syntax for the <b><tt>run</b></tt> command</h2>

<p> The <b><tt>run</tt></b> command lets you generate sample solutions
    to your model.</p>

<b><pre>
  run pred-name for # but # sig-name, exactly # sig-name
  run pred-name for # sig-name, sig-name, sig-name, # sig-name
</pre></b>

<p> If no default is given (the first # in the first of the two
    templates shown above, then it is assumed to be 3).
</p>

<p> One benefit of using the <b><tt>run</b></tt> is that it will
    increase your confidence that your model is not <a
    href="sidenote-underconstraint.html" target="sidenote">
    underconstrained</a>.  When you use <b><tt>run</b></tt> to
    generate an example of an underconstrained model, you will usually
    see an absurd situation in one of the first few attempts.  Of
    course, there are no guarantees that you won't happen to see only
    good examples -- that's what check statements are for!
</p>

<p> Doing runs to periodically check up on your system helps identify
    <a href="sidenote-overconstraint.html" target="sidenote">
    overconstraint</a>; if Alloy is unable to find <i>any</i>
    solutions when it should have, then your model is surely
    overconstrained.
