<p> In this lesson, we do not add any new features to the model, but
    instead we rewrite part of it to show you a different way to doing
    things.  The resulting model is semantically equivalent, but is a
    bit more concise and arguably clearer.

<p> Two of the four constraints which were in the
    <b><tt>FileSystem</b></tt> appended fact have been removed:

<b><pre>
  no root.parent
  contents in objects->objects
</pre></b>

<p> These constraints have been built into the other ones.  First of
    all, the line which use to read

<b><pre>
  root: Dir,
</pre></b>

<p> now reads

<b><pre>
  root: Dir & objects,
</pre></b>

<p> This defines the root of a FileSystem to be in the set of
    <b><tt>objects</b></tt> of its <b><tt>FileSystem</b></tt>, and not
    just be any old directory.  (since it is in the <a
    href="sidenote-set-ops.html" target="sidenote"> intersection</a>
    of <b><tt>Dir</b></tt> and <b><tt>objects</b></tt>).

<p> Secondly, the lines which use to read

<b><pre>
  contents: Dir lone-> FSObject,
  parent: FSObject ->lone Dir
</pre></b>

<p> now read

<b><pre>
  contents: (Dir & objects) one-> (objects - root),
  parent: (objects - root) ->one (Dir & objects)
</pre></b>

<p> This is the same trick, but a little bit messier because it has
    been done to higher arity relations (relations with more than 2
    entries in each row).  The <b><tt>(Dir & objects)</b></tt> part
    solves the problem of stray tuples in the contents relation.  The
    <b><tt>(objects - root)</b></tt> part makes sure that the root
    does not have a parent; it is not allowed to be in the 'parent
    slot' of any tuple in the
    <b><tt>parent</tt></b> relation.

<p> Also notice that the <b><tt>lone</b></tt> <a
    href="sidenote-multiplicity.html" target="sidenote">multiplicity
    markings</a> have been replaced by <b><tt>one</b></tt>'s.  Where a
    <b><tt>lone</b></tt> indicated "0 or 1", a <b><tt>one</b></tt>
    indicates "exactly 1".  Thus the first line makes sure that
    exactly one directory <b><tt>contains</b></tt> each file system
    object, and the second line makes sure that exactly one directory
    is the <b><tt>parent</b></tt> of each non-root file system object.

<p> In the next lesson, we add dynamic operations to the model,
    <b><tt>move</tt></b> and <b><tt>delete</tt></b>.
