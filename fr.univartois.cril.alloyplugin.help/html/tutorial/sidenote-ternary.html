    <h2>Thinking about higher order relations</h2>

<h3>Higher Order Relations</h3>

<p> The <i>arity</i> of a relation is the size of the tuples it
    defines.  Another way of thinking of it is that an arity <i>n</i>
    relation is one that takes <i>(n-1)</i> arguments and pairs them
    with another element (this is the same style of thinking as for
    lambda calculus currying, if that helps).  Of course, <a
    href="sidenote-relations-are-ordered-pairs.html"
    target="sidenote"> relations are not necessarily functions</a>, so
    it might pair them with zero, one, or many elements (thus,
    thinking of the first
    <i>(n-1)</i> entries in the tuples as <i>arguments</i> can be
    misleading).

<ul>
<li> unary - atoms (0 arguments)
<li> binary - relation forming order pairs (1 argument)
<li> ternary - relation forming ordered triple (2 arguments)
<li> n-ary - relation forming n-tuples (n-1 arguments)
</ul>

<p> A <i>higher order</i> relation usually refers to one which is
    ternary or greater.  For example, in the following Alloy fragment
    (from File System Lesson II),
    <b><tt>contents</b></tt> and <b><tt>parent</b></tt> are ternary
    relations.

<pre><b>
  sig FileSystem {
    root: Dir,
    objects: set FSObject,
    contents: Dir ?-> FSObject,
    parent: FSObject ->? Dir
  }
</pre></b>

<p> Given a filesystem (<b><tt>FileSystem</b></tt>), you can ask for
    its contents field, which gets you a relation from directories
    (<b><tt>Dir</b></tt>) to file system objects
    (<b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>).  That is, given a file system
    <i>and</i> a Directory, you get some set of file system objects.
    For now, don't worry about the "<b><tt>?</b></tt>".
