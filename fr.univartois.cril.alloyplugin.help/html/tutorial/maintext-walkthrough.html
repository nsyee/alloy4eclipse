<p> In this lesson, we take a look at the <i>Alloy</i> interface
    itself.  We will walkthrough the basics of how to execute a
    command to check an <i>Alloy</i> model and how to interpret the
    results.  We will continue to use our running sample model of a
    File system, and execute the <a href="sidenote-format-check.html"
    target="sidenote"> <b><tt>check</tt></b></a> statements to verify
    the <a href="sidenote-format-assert.html" target="sidenote">
    <b><tt>assert</tt></b></a>ions made in the first version of the
    model.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p> The exact output that <i>Alloy</i> gives you (the messages that
    pop up, and the interface to the visualizer) is subject to change.
    However, the basics of using the <i>Alloy</i> interface (what you
    can tell <i>Alloy</i> to do, the terminology we use, and the kind
    of information Alloy returns) remains constant.  This walkthrough
    uses version 2.0 of <i>Alloy</i> to analyze our File System
    example, and to show examples of what the resulting output and
    visualizations might look like.</p>

    inconsistency, feel free to contact us.  View <a

<h3>Basics of using Alloy</h3>

<p> At this point, you should open <i>Alloy</i>.  If you do not
    already have <i>Alloy</i> installed, you can downloaded it from
    the from the <a href="http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/alloy/"
    target="new"><i>Alloy</i> home page</a>.  Once you get
    <i>Alloy</i> up and running, you will be presented with a screen
    with two sections, looking something like this:</p>

<p><IMG SRC="alloy-blank.png" BORDER=0></p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Create a new model</b> with the 'New' button from the icon
     bar, or from the file menu. Paste in our current mode (shown to
     the right of this window), and <b>save</b> it as
     '<tt>models/examples/tutorial/fileSystem.als</tt>' (to be
     consistent with the <b><tt>module</tt></b> statement at the top
     of the model).</li>
<li> <b>Compile the model</b> with the '<tt>Build</tt>' icon or by
     selecting "<tt>Build</tt>" from the top of the <tt>Tools</tt>
     menu.</li>
<li> <b>Select a command to run</b> by choosing one from the
     '<tt>Command selection</tt>' box in the icon bar.  There will be
     one entry in the menu for each <b><tt>run</tt></b> and each
     <b><tt>check</tt></b> command.  For now, select the top choice:
     "<b><tt>check acyclic for 5</tt></b>".</li>
<li> <b>Execute the selected command</b> with the '<tt>Execute</tt>'
     icon or by choosing <tt>Execute</tt> from the <tt>Tools</tt>
     menu.  You will be told "<i>no counterexamples found: acyclic may
     be valid.(00:05)</i>", meaning that there are no counter examples
     to the <b><tt>acyclic</tt></b> assertion within a scope of 5.
     Had there been solutions, one of them would have been displayed
     in the right half of the screen in the visualizer.  The number
     given at the end is the time taken to solve the model.</li>
<li> Now let's <b>check the second command</b> the same way.  Select
     the second command ("<b><tt>check oneRoot for 5</tt></b>") from
     the <tt>Commands</tt> menu, and execute it.  There are no
     solutions found for this one either.</li>
<li> Finally, <b>check the third command</b>.  You can do this one on
     your own.</li>
</ul>

<p>    <IMG SRC="RCnosoln.png" BORDER=0></p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> In general, once you make a change to the model and want to see
    its effect on a <b><tt>run</tt></b> or a <tt><b>check</b></tt>,
    you will...</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>save</b> (<tt>ctrl+s</tt>)</li>
<li> <b>build</b> (<tt>ctrl+b</tt>)</li>
<li> <b>select</b> (from <tt>Commands</tt> menu) (last selection will
     be preserved)</li>
<li> <b>execute & visualize</b> (<tt>ctrl+e</tt>)</li>
</ul>

<p> We'll see an example of visualizing a solution next.</p>

<h3> Visualizing a counterexample to an incorrect assertion </h3>

<p> Just for fun, let's write and check an assertion which <i>does</i>
    have a solution (i.e. a counterexample).</p>

<b><pre>
  </b><i>//an assertion with a counterexample</i><b>
  assert Wrong {
    all o,p: (FSObject - Root) | (o.parent = p.parent)
  }
</pre></b>

<p> That is, we are claiming that any two non-root file system objects
    have the same parent.  Of course, if our file system is at all
    sane, then this assertion will fail and a counterexample will be
    found.  Let's check it and see.</p>

<b><pre>
  check Wrong for 3
</pre></b>

<p> Save the model, build it, select our latest command from the
    <tt>Commands</tt> menu, and execute it.  The righthand side of the
    screen will display something like this:

<p>    <IMG SRC="RCuncustomized.png" BORDER=0></p>

<p> You can also browse a tree structure of the model by selecting the
    "tree" button from the righthand icon bar.  The tree view is
    harder to read than the diagramatic form, but allows you to see
    how the predicates and functions in your model evaluated in this
    particular solution.  You can return to the diagram view by
    choosing the "viz" button from the icon bar.</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="RCtree.png" BORDER=0></p>

<p> The exact appearance (and even the counter-example returned) may
    vary between versions of Alloy, so don't worry if it looks a
    little different.  Everything we say here will still apply.</p>

<p> You can make the visualization more readable by customizing the
    layout -- selection the "layout" button from the icon bar.  You
    can adjust what relations and sets are shown, and the style of
    their presentation.  Here is a cleaner customization.</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="RCcustomized.png" BORDER=0></p>

<p> Now let's see what happens what would have happened if we'd chosen
    a smaller scope:</p>

<b><pre>
  check Wrong for 2
</pre></b>

<p> Whoops!  No solutions were found.  If the scope is too small,
    there may be no solutions found, just because the smallest
    solution is larger than you allowed.  This is an unavoidable risk
    of Model Checking, but it is mitigated by the "small scope
    hypothesis".  <i>Alloy</i> <u>does</u> guarantee that if there is
    any example within the specified scope that an example will be
    returned to the user.  If there are several, you may not get the
    smallest one, so it is often helpful to try smaller and smaller
    scopes to find the smallest scope that still generates a solution.

<b><pre>
  check Wrong for 15
</pre></b>

We might get a solution such as this one:

<p>    <IMG SRC="RCcomplexsimple.png" BORDER=0></p>

<p> Or, with some minor customizations, we get the much more readable:</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="RCcomplexcustomized.png" BORDER=0></p>

<h3>Discussion: Non-Determinism</h3>

<p> If you've gotten different results than we show here, don't be
    alarmed; it may be because you have a different version of
    <i>Alloy</i>, or it may be because of <i>Alloy</i>'s
    non-deterministic nature.  That is, Alloy only guarantees that it
    will return <i>a</i> solution, not the smallest and not even
    necessarily the same one each time.  By default, an option is set
    which makes sure that running </i>identical</i> commands will
    produce the same examples (if any).  However, running
    syntactically different (but semantically equivalent) commands may
    produce different examples.</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<h3>Discussion: Facts vs. Assertions</h3>

<p> While a <b><tt>fact</tt></b> is used to <i>force</i> something to
    be true of the model, an <b><tt>assert</tt></b> is a claim that
    something <i>must already</i> be true due to the rest of the
    model.  There are three ways of thinking about this difference,
    which are worth reading through even if you think the difference
    is obvious.</p>

<p> One way of examining this difference is considering what happens
    if you accidentally write a constraint which is trivially
    false.</p>

<ul>
<li> A trivially false <b><tt>fact</tt></b> results in there being no
     solutions to the model no matter what the rest of the model looks
     like.  This is an extreme version of <a
     href="sidenote-overconstraint.html" target="sidenote">
     overconstraining</a> your model.  Overconstraint is dangerous,
     since it means that any other <b><tt>assert</tt></b> statement
     that you <b><tt>check</tt></b> will trivially have no solutions,
     thus potentially masking both errors in your model and (worse)
     failings in the subject matter you are modeling.
</li>
<li> A trivially false <b><tt>assert</tt></b> will result in
     counterexamples being found when it is <b><tt>check</tt></b>ed.
     Since anything makes such an assertion false, any example of the
     system will be a counterexample.  As a result, the solution
     returned may appear completely unrelated to the assertion it
     falsifies. For this reason, <a
     href="sidenote-overconstraint.html" target="sidenote">
     vacuous</a> assertions are easy to identify but can be annoying to
     track down and repair.
</li>
</ul>

<p> Another way is to consider what happens if you mistakenly write a
    constraint with one construct when you should have used the
    other.</p>
<ul>
<li> An <b><tt>assert</tt></b>ion which should have been a
     <b><tt>fact</tt></b> is something which is not necessarily true,
     but which you are assuming is true.  These are usually sanity
     constraints which you have simply forgotten to write down.  This
     means that your model is <a href="sidenote-underconstraint.html"
     target="sidenote"> underconstrained</a>; you are permitting
     possibilities you wished to discount.  You can use the <a
     href="sidenote-format-run.html" target="sidenote">
     <b><tt>run</tt></b> command to help identify underconstraint</a>,
     since random instances of an underconstrained model tend to be
     absurd in obvious ways.</li>
<li> A <i>true</i> <b><tt>fact</tt></b> which should have been an
     <b><tt>assert</tt></b>ion is redundant; it is implied by the
     other constraints on your model, and yet you have explicitly (and
     redundantly) forced it to hold.</li>
<li> A <i>false</i> <b><tt>fact</tt></b> which should have been an
     <b><tt>assert</tt></b>ion is dangerous; it results in an <a
     href="sidenote-overconstraint.html" target="sidenote">
     overconstraint</a> on your system, potentially making all other
     <b><tt>check</tt></b> statements trivially find no
     counterexamples (even when they are checking preposterous
     assertions).</li>
</ul>

<p> Yet another way to think about the difference is in terms of their
    interaction.</p>
<ul>
<li> <b><tt>Facts</tt></b> are "always on"; Alloy discounts any
     solution to the model which violates any fact.  In this sense,
     every fact interacts with every other fact, since all of them
     always apply.</li>
<li> <b><tt>Assert</tt></b>ions can only be checked one at a time, and
     thus do not interact at all.  If you want to check more than one
     assertion at a time (or you want to see a counterexample which
     satisfies several different assertions), then write a new
     assertion which asserts the component assertions.</li>
<li> In the next lesson (Lesson II), we will learn about functions
     (<b><tt>fun</tt></b>) and predicates (<b><tt>pred</tt></b>) which
     fall somewhere inbetween facts and assertions in terms of how
     they interact with each other.  We will be able to say things
     like "if <i>A</i> holds then each <i>X</i> must satisfy
     <i>B</i>"; these functions don't have to be checked one at a time
     (as opposed to assertions) but they can be selectively applied
     (as opposed to facts).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Before Moving On</h3>

<p> Before proceeding to the second version of the File System
    example, it is a good idea to read about the <a
    href="sidenote-levels-of-understanding.html"
    target="sidenote">three levels of abstraction for reading an
    <i>Alloy</i> model</a>, if you have not already done so.  You have
    now had enough opportunity to play around with Alloy to benefit
    from seeing different ways of looking at it.</p>
