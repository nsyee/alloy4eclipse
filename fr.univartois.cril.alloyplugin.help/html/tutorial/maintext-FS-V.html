<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p> Now that we've built a model that ensures the structural
    correctness of our file system, we can begin to analyze operations
    that mutate file systems.  Let's begin with a function to define
    the <b><tt>move</b></tt> operation.  But first, a philosophical
    note...

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> In an <a href="sidenote-operational-declarative.html"
    target="sidenote"> imperative</a> model, you might ask yourself
    "<i>how can I make X happen?</i>".  In a <a
    href="sidenote-operational-declarative.html"
    target="sidenote">declarative</a> model (like Alloy), you ask
    yourself "<i>how would I recognize that X has been
    accomplished?</i>".

<p> One reflection of this is that functions in Alloy only ever
    evaluate to <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>.  In an imperative
    language, you might make the <b><tt>move</tt></b> function take a
    file system, an object to be moved, and a directory to move it to
    as arguments, and then have it return a new file system where that
    object has been moved to that directory.  What we do in Alloy is
    to make all those things arguments to the function, including the
    'output'.  The function then returns true if the output parameter
    is valid given the input parameters, and false if it is not.  If
    we later say "make sure this function is always true", then you
    will only get back examples where valid moves occur.  The output
    parameter is always the second one.

<b><pre>
1. fun move (fs, fs': FileSystem, f: FSObject, d: Dir) {
2.   (f + d) in fs.objects
3.   fs'.contents = fs.contents - f.(fs.parent)->f + d->f
4. }
</b></pre>

<p> The function <b><tt>move</b></tt> is true if file system
    <b><tt>fs'</b></tt> is the result of moving file system object
    <b><tt>f</b></tt> to directory <b><tt>d</b></tt> in file system
    <b><tt>fs</b></tt>.  In this function, we can think of file system
    <b><tt>fs</b></tt> as the pre-state and <b><tt>fs'</b></tt> as the
    post-state, but the prime character has no semantic meaning in and
    of itself.  Although it would be confusing, we could have named
    the pre-state <b><tt>fs'</b></tt> and the post-state
    <b><tt>fs</b></tt>.

<p> Line 2 stipulates that the object to be moved and the destination
    directory of the move must both exist in the pre-state file
    system.  Line 3 is a little tricky.  It states that the relation
    from directories to their contents in the post-state is the same
    as it was in the pre-state, except that the mapping from
    <b><tt>f</b></tt>'s parent to <b><tt>f</b></tt> is replaced with
    the mapping from <b><tt>d</b></tt> to <b><tt>f</b></tt>.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> We can view an example of a move by adding the following command
    to our model and then executing it.

<b><pre>
  run move for 2 FileSystem, 4 FSObject
</b></pre>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> Now let's add an assertion to give us confidence that the
    <b><tt>move</tt></b> is correct. The assertion
    <b><tt>moveWorks</b></tt> claims that the move operation does not
    alter the root of the file system or change the set of objects in
    the file system.

<b><pre>
  assert moveWorks {
    all fs, fs': FileSystem, f: FSObject, d:Dir |
      move(fs, fs', f, d) =>
        (fs.root = fs'.root && fs.objects = fs'.objects)
  }
</b></pre>

<p> Let's check this solution within a scope of 5 by adding and executing 
    the following command to our model.

<b><pre>
  check moveWorks for 5
</b></pre>

<p> Alloy finds no solutions when executing this command, indicating
    that there are no counterexamples to the moveWorks assertion
    within a scope of 5.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> Our <b><tt>move</b></tt> function seems to work fine, so let's
    move on to writing a delete function. In fact, we will write two
    delete functions: one to delete a single file or empty directory
    (similar to "rm" and "rmdir" in Unix), and one to perform
    recursive deletion (like "rm -r").

<b><pre>
1. fun delete (fs, fs': FileSystem, f: FSObject) {
2.   f in fs.(objects - root)
3.   no f.(fs.contents)
4.   fs'.contents = fs.contents - f.(fs.parent)->f
5. }
</b></pre>
<p> and
<b><pre>
1. fun deleteRecurse (fs, fs': FileSystem, f: FSObject) {
2.   f in fs.(objects - root)
3.   let subtree = f.*(fs.contents) |
4.     fs'.contents = fs.contents - subtree.(fs.parent)->subtree
5. }
</pre></b>

<p> Line 2 is the same in <b><tt>delete</tt></b> and
    <b><tt>deleteRecurse</tt></b>. It stipulates that the file system
    object to be deleted, <b><tt>f</tt></b>, must be in the pre-state
    file system, <b><tt>fs</tt></b>, but that it cannot be the root of
    <b><tt>fs</tt></b>.  Certainly, it doesn't make sense to delete a
    file from a file system if it isn't there; nor does it make sense
    to delete the root of a file system (since we require all file
    systems to have roots).

<p> Line 3 of <b><tt>delete</tt></b>, <b><tt>no
    f.(fs.contents)</tt></b>, constrains the file system object
    <b><tt>f</tt></b> to have no contents in the pre-state
    <b><tt>fs</tt></b>. This allows <b><tt>f</tt></b> to be both files
    and empty directories. We didn't include this constraint in
    <b><tt>deleteRecurse</tt></b> because it can delete non-empty
    directories as well. Line 4 of delete constrains the post-state
    file system to be the same as the pre-state file system, except
    with the mapping from <b><tt>f</tt></b>'s parent to
    <b><tt>f</tt></b> removed.

<p> Line 3 of <b><tt>deleteRecurse</tt></b> uses a let statement. A
    let statement acts as a macro replacing the right-side of the
    assignment wherever the left-side of the assignment appears. That
    is, lines 3 and 4 desugar to (and are interpreted by Alloy as) the
    following:

<b><pre>
  fs'.contents = fs.contents - 
    (f.*(fs.contents)).(fs.parent)->(f.*(fs.contents))
</b></pre>

<p> Because it is just syntactic sugar, the let construct is never
    necessary, but it tends to make Alloy code more understandable.

<p> The expression on the right hand side of the assignment,
    <b><tt>f.*(fs.contents)</tt></b>, is the set of files and
    directories obtained by following the contents relation in file
    system <b><tt>fs</tt></b> zero or more times starting at file
    system object <b><tt>f</tt></b>. In other words, it is the set of
    all file system objects in the subtree rooted at
    <b><tt>f</tt></b>. Thus, this constraint states that the contents
    relation in the post-state file system is the contents relation in
    the pre-state minus all mappings from parents of objects in the
    subtree to objects in the substree.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> Now let's verify the correctness of our delete functions with
    assertions. Our assertions claim that the functions to do not
    alter the root of the file system; that the rows in the contents
    relation of the post-state is a subset of the rows in the
    pre-state; and that they remove exactly the objects they should.

<b><pre>
  assert deleteWorks {
    all fs, fs': FileSystem, f: FSObject  |
      delete(fs, fs', f) =>
        (fs.root = fs'.root && fs.objects - f = fs'.objects)
  }
</b></pre>
<p> and
<b><pre>
  assert deleteRecurseWorks {
    all fs, fs': FileSystem, f: FSObject |
      deleteRecurse(fs, fs', f) =>
        (fs.root = fs'.root && fs.objects - f.*(fs.contents) = fs'.objects)
  }
</b></pre>

<p> And we will check these two assertions by writing and executing
    the following two commands:

<b><pre>
  check deleteWorks for 5
  check deleteRecurseWorks for 5
</b></pre>

<p> Alloy produces a counterexample for each of these commands; so the
    assertions must not be true. But before we even begin to inspect
    the counterexamples, let's first lower the scope of the check
    commands to 4, recompile, and execute the commands again. Again,
    alloy produces counterexamples.  Then we try a scope of 3, then 2,
    and finally 1. It turns out the smallest scope in which a
    counterexample still exists is 2. It is typically helpful to
    progressively lower the scope on the check commands until no more
    counterexamples are found.  (In future versions of Alloy, there
    will be a <b><tt>checkMin</tt></b> command to perform this process
    automatically.)

<p> We will examine and correct these errors in the next (and final)
    lesson.
