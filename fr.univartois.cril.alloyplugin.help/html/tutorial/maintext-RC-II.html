    Crossing problem statement</a>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p> We would now like to say that all the <b><tt>Object</b></tt>s are
    on the near side of the river in the first state. We would also
    like to ask Alloy to find a solution in which all the objects are
    on the far side of the river in the last state. The problem is we
    do not yet have a way of talking about the first state, the last
    state, or the fact that one may come before or after another. In
    sum, we need a way to construct a linear ordering of states and
    refer to properties of that ordering. Luckily, Alloy comes with a
    polymorphic linear ordering module that can do that work for
    us. We <a href="sidenote-combining-modules.html"
    target="sidenote"> import this module</a> by adding the following
    line to the beginning of our model.  We parametarize on
    <b><tt>State</tt></b>, so now we can call order comparison
    operations on elements of the <b><tt>State</tt></b> signature.
</p>

<b><pre>
1. open util/ordering[State]
</pre></b>

<p> You may wish to take some time to familiarize yourself with the
    linear ordering module.</p>

<ul>
<li> Load the <a href="currentmodel-Ord-simple.html" target="currentmodel">
     Ord module</a> text
<li> Reload the <a href="currentmodel-RC-I.html"
     target="currentmodel"> River Crossing module</a> text
</ul>

<p> This is how we can use the <b><tt>Ord</b></tt> module to say all
    the <b><tt>Object</b></tt>s are on the near side of the river and
    none are on the far side in the initial state:
</p>

<b><pre>
1. fact initialState {
2.    let s0 = first() |
3.      s0.near = Object && no s0.far
4. }
</pre></b>

<p> If you're thinking about this problem in terms of a state machine,
    this fact constrained the starting state of the state machine. Now
    let's describe a transition function between states.
</p>

<p> At any state, we will call the side of the river the farmer is
    currently on the '<b><tt>from</b></tt>' side and the other side
    the '<b><tt>to</b></tt>' side. So our function will stipulate how
    the set of objects on the '<b><tt>from</b></tt>' and
    '<b><tt>to</b></tt>' sides change from state to state. Thus, we
    have the following signature for our transition function:
</p>

<b><pre>
1. pred crossRiver (from, from', to, to': set Object) { . . . }
</pre></b>

<p> Next, we know the farmer can take at most one object with him
    across the river. In other words, the from side of the river will
    lose the <b><tt>Farmer</b></tt> plus <i>at most</i> one other
    <b><tt>Object</b></tt> (he can travel alone).
</p>

<b><pre>
0. pred crossRiver (from, from', to, to': set Object) {
1.   </b><i>// either the Farmer takes no items</i><b>
2.   ( from' = from - Farmer && 
3.     to' = to - to.eats + Farmer ) ||
4.   </b><i>// or the Farmer takes one item</i><b>
5.   some item: from - Farmer {
6.     from' = from - Farmer - item
7.     to' = to - to.eats + Farmer + item
8.    }
9. }
</pre></b>

<p> The <b><tt>some</b></tt> quantifier means '1 or more', but
    actually there can't be more because of the way this constrain is
    written.  Take a moment to think about why that is the case, then
    load the <a href="sidenote-answer-other.html" target="sidenote">
    answer</a> as a sidenote.
</p>

<!-- That is, if there were another, then that one's constraint would
violate this one's constraint -- from' can't equal farmer - item1 AND
farmer - item2] -->

<p> The '<b><tt>to</b></tt>' side of the river isn't as straight
    forward. Because the farmer isn't on that side, some of his
    possessions may get eaten if left alone. If the
    '<b><tt>to</b></tt>' side has just the <b><tt>Fox</b></tt> and
    <b><tt>Chicken</b></tt>, for instance, then afterwards, it will
    have the <b><tt>Fox</b></tt>, the <b><tt>Farmer</b></tt>, and the
    <b><tt>item</b></tt> (if any) that the farmer brought with
    him. If the '<b><tt>to</b></tt>' side has
    the <b><tt>Fox</b></tt>, the <b><tt>Chicken</b></tt>, and the
    <b><tt>Grain</b></tt>, we will assume both the
    <b><tt>Chicken</b></tt> and the <b><tt>Grain</b></tt> are eaten
    (You could also argue that only the chicken gets eaten, but it
    doesn't matter since either way the farmer will have
    failed).
