= Upcoming features (in order of priority) =
  # Improved configuration/properties management
  # Manage platform dependent binaries (SAT solvers, dotbin) with Eclipse plugins
  # ~~Code format~~ (looks too dependent of Alloy4 compiler)
  # Quick fix


Note that some features might be easily implemented at some point so they will likely be added before the ones needed more work, even if of lower priority.
