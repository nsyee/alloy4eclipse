<p> The scope 2 counterexample for each of the commands is the
    same. The structure of the counterexample includes two
    <b><tt>FSObjects</tt></b>, <b><tt>FSObject1</tt></b> and
    <b><tt>FSObject2</tt></b>, both of which are directories,
    <b><tt>FSObject2</tt></b> being the one which is deleted. In
    file system <b><tt>fs</tt></b>, the pre-state,
    <b><tt>FSObject1</tt></b> is the root and
    <b><tt>FSObject1->FSObject2</tt></b> is the only row of the
    contents relation. In file system <b><tt>fs'</tt></b> (the
    post-state), the <b><tt>contains</tt></b> relation is empty and
    <b><tt>FSObject2</tt></b> is the root. So the delete functions can
    change the root, making the assertion fail.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> Why can this happen? First, let's note that both delete functions
    cause the rows of the contents relation in the post-state to be a
    subset of the rows in the pre-state. And we know the
    <b><tt>FileSystem</tt></b> appended facts "<b><tt>objects =
    root.*contents</tt></b>" and "<b><tt>contents in
    objects->objects</tt></b>" constrains the root of the file system
    to be the root of the contents relation. So if the post-state has
    a non-empty <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation, it will have the
    same root as the pre-state. However if delete function causes the
    post-state to have an empty contents relation, then the root is
    free to change arbitrarily, to any directory available.  Bet you
    didn't see that coming.  Good thing we wrote a model!

<p> We can amend our delete functions to stipulate that if the
    <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation of the post-state is empty, then
    it's root must be the same as the root of the pre-state.

<p> We could have just constrained the roots to always be equal.  That
    would work just as well, but in general it is a good idea to write
    the weakest constraints you can that get the job done.  This
    leaves the model flexible and may reveal more bugs in your system.
    The amended delete functions look as follows:

<b><pre>
  fun delete (fs, fs': FileSystem, f: FSObject) {
    f in fs.(objects - root)
    no f.(fs.contents)
    fs'.contents = fs.contents - f.(fs.parent)->f
    no fs'.contents => fs'.root = fs.root // new constraint
  }
</b></pre>
<p>and
<b><pre>
  fun deleteRecurse (fs, fs': FileSystem, f: FSObject) {
    f in fs.(objects - root)
    let subtree = f.*(fs.contents) |
      fs'.contents = fs.contents - subtree.(fs.parent)->subtree
    no fs'.contents => fs'.root = fs.root // new constraint
  }
</b></pre>

<p> When we check the assertions up to a scope of 5, Alloy finds no
    counterexamples.  We can be fairly certain that our functions work
    as intended.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> As one final sanity check, let's verify that
    <b><tt>delete</tt></b> and <b><tt>deleteRecurse</tt></b> are
    equivalent when the deleted object is a file or empty
    directory:

<b><pre>
  assert equivalentDeletes {
    all fs: FileSystem, f: FSObject |
      no f.(fs.contents) =>
        all fs': FileSystem |
          delete(fs, fs', f) <=> deleteRecurse(fs, fs', f)
  }
</b></pre>
<p> and then check it:
<b><pre>
  check equivalentDeletes for 5
</b></pre>

<p> Alloy finds no counterexamples, thus further reassuring us that
    the delete functions were written correctly and that the system we
    are modeling does not have errors.  The final version of the model
    is in the upper righthand frame.

<p> As an exercise, try finding some more shortcomings of the model
    and enhance it.  As a starting place, try executing the following:

<b><pre>
  run example for 2 FileSystem, 6 FSObject
</pre></b>
