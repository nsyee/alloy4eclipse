    <h2>Declarative vs. Operational (Imperative) Modeling</h2>

<p> Roughly speaking, there are two ways to describe a system:
    <i>operationally</i> (also called "imperative") and
    <i>declaratively</i>.  An operational modeller asks "<i>how would
    I make X happen?</i>". A declarative modeller asks "<i>how would I
    recognize that X has happened?</i>".  In many contexts, it is more
    natural and concise to use a declarative description.  Often one
    need only to describe the rules of the game and what it means to
    have won, and not even think about what moves will be needed (and
    which must be avoided) in order to win.

<p> In the spirit of being declarative, the order of statements in an
    Alloy model does not affect its meaning (as long as they remain
    syntactically well-formed).  All the constraints must hold, but
    there is no notion of an ordering on them.

    choosing between declarative and operational paradigms can be
