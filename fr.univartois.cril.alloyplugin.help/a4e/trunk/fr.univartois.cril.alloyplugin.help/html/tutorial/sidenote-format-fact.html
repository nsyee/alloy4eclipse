    <h2>Syntax for <i>fact</i> statements</h2>

<b><pre>
  fact [name] {
    [list of constraints]
    [multiple constraints are implicitly conjoined]
  }
</pre></b>

<p> Facts do not need to have names, and are never refered to by name.
    However, good names improve clarity tremendously. </p>

<p> <i>A warning</i><b>:</b> When Alloy searches for examples, it
    discards any which violate any <b><tt>fact</tt></b>.  Thus, if the
    fact is trivially false, then you will simply get no examples of
    file systems, even if the assertion you are checking has
    counterexamples.  It will appear the same as if the model were bug
    free and the assertion you are checking is correct.  You can use
    the <a href="sidenote-format-run.html" target="sidenote">
    <b><tt>run</tt></b> command</a> to check for such simpleminded <a
    href="sidenote-overconstraint.html" target="sidenote">
    overconstraints<a/>.  More advanced overconstraint detection tools
    will be available in future versions of Alloy. </p>

<p> Many facts can also be written as <a
    href="sidenote-format-appended-fact.html" target="sidenote">
    <i>appended facts</i></a>, which can make your models clearer and
    more concise. </p>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p> <a href="sidenote-all.html" target="sidenote"> list all sidenotes</a>
<p> <a href="sidenote-default.html">clear this sidenote</a>
