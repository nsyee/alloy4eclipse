<p> In <a href="currentmodel-walkthrough.html"
    onClick="window.self.location='maintext-walkthrough.html'"
    target="currentmodel">Lesson I</a>, we successfully modeled a
    simple file system. It had file system objects (which were divided
    into files and directories), a single root directory, and parent
    and child relationships between the file system objects. We
    verified through Alloy assertions that the system obeyed certain
    correctness properties.</p>

<p> However, our model is static: It has a set of file system objects
    and relations between them, but that set and those relations
    cannot change in any way. Thus, the model is inadequate if we'd
    like to model dynamic aspects of file systems, such as <tt>move</tt> and
    <tt>delete</tt> operations. To do so, we will create a model that
    allows for multiple file systems, and we will express
    "<tt>move</tt>" and "<tt>delete</tt>" as transitions between these
    file systems. That is, each file system can be thought of as a
    different version of the same file system after a mutating
    operation has been performed.</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> Like all Alloy models, we begin with a <b><tt>module</tt></b>
    statement.  Our first signature declaration declares a set of file
    system objects called <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>, just like it did
    in the previous version.  However, this time the body is empty --
    it does not contain a <b><tt>parent</tt></b> relation field.
    Since this model will allow for multiple file systems, the parent
    relation is not a single entity that exists between all file
    system objects; there is a different one for each file system, so
    it belongs with the <b><tt>FileSystem</tt></b> signature
    (discussed below)</p>

<b><pre>
  module tutorial/file_system

  </b><i>// A file system object in the file system</i><b>
  sig FSObject {}
</pre></b>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> Next we see a single <a href="sidenote-format-sig.html"
    target="sidenote"> signature</a> being used to declare both
    <b><tt>File</b></tt> and <b><tt>Dir</b></tt> simultaneously.  As
    before, they are disjoint subsets of <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt>.
    However, this time theirs bodies are identical (both are empty),
    so we can define them more compactly in a single statement.</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> The third and final signature in the model declares the set
    <b><tt>FileSystem</b></tt>, representing the set of all file
    systems.  The body of this signature declares four relations that
    every file system needs: <b><tt>root</b></tt>,
    <b><tt>objects</b></tt>, <b><tt>contents</b></tt>, and
    <b><tt>parent</b></tt>. Note that when multiple fields are
    declared within a single signature body, they are separated by
    commas.
</p>

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// A File System</i><b>
  sig FileSystem {
    root: Dir,
    objects: set FSObject,
    contents: Dir lone-> FSObject,
    parent: FSObject ->lone Dir
  }
</pre></b>

<p> The first signature relates each file system to exactly one
    directory, its <b><tt>root</b></tt>.
</p>

<p> The <b><tt>objects</b></tt> relation relates each file system to
    the set of file system objects it contains. The
    <tt><b>set</tt></b> keyword allows the contents relation to relate
    <b><tt>FileSystem</b></tt>s to any number of file system objects
    (even zero).  Omitting the <tt><b>set</b></tt> keyword would
    constrain the <b><tt>objects</tt></b> relation to map every file
    system to exactly one file system object -- a mistake if you want
    non-trivial file systems!  Actually, due to constraints later in
    the model, every file system must have at least 1 file system
    object.
</p>

<p> You'll notice that the syntax of the <b><tt>contents</tt></b> and
    <b><tt>parent</tt></b> relations are markedly different from the
    other fields.
</p>

<pre><b>  contents: Dir lone-> FSObject,
  parent: FSObject ->lone Dir
</b></pre>

<p> These are <a href="sidenote-ternary.html" target="sidenote">
    ternary relations</a>, defined using the <a
    href="sidenote-format-arrow.html" target="sidenote"> relational
    product</a> operator ("<b><tt>-></b></tt>").  Think of them as
    fields which are themselves relations.  The
    <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation maps each file system to a
    binary relation from directories to file system
    objects. Similarly, <b><tt>parent</tt></b> relates each file
    system to file system objects to directories.
</p>

<p> When declaring a ternary relation, <a
    href="sidenote-multiplicity.html" target="sidenote"> multiplicity
    markings</a> may be placed on either side of the arrow.  In this
    model, we've used the "<b><tt>lone</b></tt>" multiplicity marking on
    the left side of the arrow in the <b><tt>contents</tt></b>
    relation and on the right side of the arrow in the
    <b><tt>parent</tt></b> relation. The "<b><tt>lone</b></tt>"
    marking means "<i>zero or one</i>" just like when it is used as a
    quantifier. In the <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation, the
    "<b><tt>lone</b></tt>" constrains each <b><tt>FSObject</b></tt> to
    be in the contents of at most one directory in a given file
    system. In the <b><tt>parent</b></tt> relation, it means every
    file system object in a given file system has at most one
    parent. </p>
</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">


<p> There are three constraints in <b><tt>FileSystem</b></tt>'s
    appended fact. </p>
</p>

<pre><b>  {
    </b><i>// root has no parent</i><b>
    no root.parent
    </b><i>// objects are those reachable from the root</i><b>
    objects in root.*contents
    </b><i>// parent is the inverse of contents</i><b>
    parent = ~contents
  }
</b></pre>

<p> Of course, this appended fact could have been written as a
    separate <b><tt>fact</tt></b> statement, as follows:
</p>

<b><pre>
1. fact {
2.   all fs: FileSystem {
3.     no fs.root.parent
4.     fs.objects in fs.root.*(fs.contents)
5.     fs.parent = ~fs.contents
6.   }
7. }
</pre></b>

<p> Line 3 says that the root directory of a file system has no
    parent. Line 4 constrains the set of all objects in the file
    system to be reachable from the root by following the
    <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation zero or more times.  Line 5
    ensures the <b><tt>parent</tt></b> relation is always the inverse
    of the contents relation.  That is, <b><tt>f in
    d.contents</tt></b> if and only if <b><tt>d in
    f.parent</tt></b>.
</p>

<p> Note that the constraints in the signature fact are defining what
    the relations <i>mean</i> more than they are actually imposing
    external constraints on the relations.  It is common practice to
    using appended facts to further define the system with sanity
    constraints, while reserving <b><tt>fact</tt></b> statements to
    impose less trivial and more domain-specific constraints.
</p>

<p> Here we saw a slightly different way of writing a quantifier.
    Rather than separating the quantification from the predicate with
    a bar, "<b><tt>|</tt></b>", we surround the predicate in curly
    braces, "<b><tt>{}</b></tt>".  Using curly braces can sometimes
    make the quantified statement easier to read. </p>

<p> Let's now generate some example visualizations of our file
    system. We will create an empty <a
    href="sidenote-format-pred.html" target="sidenote"> predicate</a>
    called <b><tt>example</b></tt> which we will run to generate such
    instances.
</p>

<b><pre>
  pred example() {}
</pre></b>

<p> The final statement of the model is an Alloy run command. When
    executed, it will try to find a solution to the model in which
    there is exactly 1 <b><tt>FileSystem</tt></b> and up to 4
    <b><tt>FileSytemObjects</tt></b>.
</p>

<b><pre>
  run example for exactly 1 FileSystem, 4 FSObject
</pre></b>

<p> There are several <a href="sidenote-alternative-run-example.html"
    target="sidenote"> equivalent ways to specify the scope for this
    command</a>. </p>
</p>

<!--
<p> Browsing through some visualizations generated by the execution of
    example, you may come across some strange-looking file
    structures. This is to be expected - this model still generates
    some illegal file structures, but we'll fix those in the next
    lesson.  Discovering possibilities which you had not thought of
    (or had thought were excluded by your constraints) is what
    modeling is all about. </p>
