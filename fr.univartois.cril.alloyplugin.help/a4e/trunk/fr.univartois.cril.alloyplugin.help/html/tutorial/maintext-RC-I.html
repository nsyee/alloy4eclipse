<p> In this tutorial, we will be modelling and finding a solution to
    the <a href="sidenote-RC-puzzle.html" target="sidenote"> Farmer
    River Crossing Puzzle</a>:

<p> A farmer is on one shore of a river and has with him a <b>fox</b>,
    a <b>chicken</b>, and a sack of <b>grain</b>. He has a boat that
    fits one object besides himself.  In the presense of the farmer
    nothing gets eaten, but if left without the farmer, the fox will
    eat the chicken, and the chicken will eat the grain.  How can the
    farmer get all three possessions across the river safely?

<p> In this chapter, we are not trying to verify a global property of
    a system, nor are we verifying that particular operations fulfill
    their specifications, as in the file system example. Rather, we
    are trying to find a single solution, or trace, of a given state
    machine. The solution to this puzzle will be a sequence of states
    that represent the farmer's trips across the river.  We will look
    for a trace satisfing the puzzle in exactly the same manner we
    would search for a (counter)example satisfying some definition of
    an unsafe or undesirable circumstance.

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> The model begins the same as any other, with a <a
    href="sidenote-format-module.html" target="sidenote">
    <b><tt>module</b></tt> statement</a> specifying the location of
    the package it is a part of.  For now, ignore the
    <b><tt>open</b></tt> command which follows.

<p> We begin our model proper with a <a
    href="sidenote-format-sig.html" target="sidenote"> signature</a>
    <b><tt>Object</b></tt>, which represents the set of the Farmer and
    his possessions. We partition the <b><tt>Object</b></tt> set into
    four singleton subsets: <b><tt>Farmer</b></tt>,
    <b><tt>Fox</b></tt>, <b><tt>Chicken</b></tt>, and
    <b><tt>Grain</b></tt>.

<b><pre>
1. abstract sig Object {eats: set Object}
2. sig Farmer, Fox, Chicken, Grain extends Object {}
</pre></b>

<p> We then create a signature called <b><tt>State</b></tt>, which
    represents the set of states in our model. In each state, there
    are a certain set of objects on the near side of the river, and a
    certain set on the far side of the river.

<b><pre>
1. sig State {
2.   near: set Object,
3.   far: set Object
4. }
</pre></b>

<p> Next we will provide the notion of an ordering on these States.
