    <h2>Multiplicity Markings</h2>

<p>When defining a field of a signature to be a relation, you write something like this:</p>

<pre><b>
  Sig Univeristy {
    groupMember: Student -> Professor
  }
</b></pre>

<p> Here, each Univerity knows which student is a member of which
    professor's research group.  That is, there is a relation from
    Univeristies to Students to Professors.  By writing multiplicity
    markings to the declaration of the relation, we can add additional
    constraints in a concise way.  For example, </p>

<pre><b>
  Sig Univeristy {
    groupMember: Student -> one Professor
  }
</b></pre>

<p> means that each student is in exactly one professor's research
    group. If we instead wrote this,</p>

<pre><b>
  Sig Univeristy {
    groupMember: Student -> lone Professor
  }
</b></pre>

<p> Then we are saying that some students may be in no research group,
but no student is in more than one. Lastly, we can write</p>

<pre><b>
  Sig Univeristy {
    groupMember: Student -> some Professor
  }
</b></pre>

<p> to say that each student is in one or more research groups.  When
    no multiplicity markings are present, there are not
    constraints.</p>

<p> You can also write multiplicity markings before the arrow.  For example, </p>

<pre><b>
  Sig Univeristy {
    groupMember: Student some -> Professor
  }
</b></pre>

<p> This says that every professor has at least one student in her
    research group.  We can put markings on both sides of the arrow as
    such:

<pre><b>
  Sig Univeristy {
    groupMember: Student some -> lone Professor
  }
</b></pre>

<p> Here, every research group has at least one student, and each student is in up to one research group.</p>

<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> You can also place the <b><tt>lone</tt></b> and
    <b><tt>one</tt></b> multiplicity markings on signatures to control
    how many copies of that signature can exist (or, really, how many
    elements can ever be in that set defined by that signature).  For
    example:</p>

<pre><b>
  one sig Root {...}
  lone sig University {...}
  some sig InitialState {...}
</b></pre>
