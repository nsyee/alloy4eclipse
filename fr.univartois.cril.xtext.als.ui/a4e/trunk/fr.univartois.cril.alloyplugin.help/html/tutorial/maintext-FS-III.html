<p> The model we developed in Lesson 2 still has some problems. For
    instance, the following file system is desperately in need of
    help:</p>

<p>   <IMG SRC="file_system2-example.gif" BORDER=0></p>

<p> The problem with this instance is that the bottom-right Dir is
    reachable from the root which is not considered to be a object in
    the file system (it is not labeled 'objects').  That directory is
    reachable from teh file system, but is not part of it!  When we
    wrote</p>

<b><pre>
  objects in root.*contents
</b></pre>

<p> we ensured that all objects in the file system are reachable from
    the root, but failed to guarantee that all objects reachable from
    the root are in the file system.  We should instead have written</p>

<b><pre>
  objects = root.*contents
</pre></b>


<hr WIDTH="50%">

<p> The <b><tt>example</tt></b> functions still generates a
    few unusual file structures, such as this one:</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="file_system2-example2.gif" BORDER=0></p>

<p> Our previous problem is gone, but now there are stray
    <a href="sidenote-relations-are-ordered-pairs.html"
    target="sidenote"> tuples</a> in the <b><tt>contents</b></tt>
    relation. That is, the <b><tt>contents</b></tt> relation is
    defining relationships between file system objects which are not
    in any file system.  We can fix this by constraining all the
    tuples in the contents relation to be between objects that are in
    its file system. Adding the following constraint to the appended
    fact achieves this</p>

<b><pre>
  contents in objects->objects
</pre></b>

<p> Recall that <a href="sidenote-relations-are-ordered-pairs.html"
    target="sidenote"> an Alloy relation is just a set of tuples</a>
    and also that the "<b><tt>-></b></tt>" operator denotes <a
    href="sidenote-format-arrow.html" target="sidenote"> relational
    product</a>.  Thus <b><tt>objects->objects</tt></b> is a way of
    saying "a relation from objects to objects" or "all the 2-element tuples
    where both elements are objects".  This constraint says that the
    <b><tt>contents</tt></b> relation of a file system only maps
    between <b><tt>objects</tt></b> of that file system.</p>

<p> The resulting bug-free model is shown in the upper-right frame.
    In the next lesson, we look at a different way to solve these same
    problems.</p>

<p> We can view samples solutions to the model by executing the
    <b><tt>run</tt></b> command. Since this is a <b><tt>run</b></tt>
    command, not a <b><tt>check</tt></b> command, solutions it
    generates are not counterexamples -- no claim has been made so
    there's nothing to disprove! If you execute the
    <b><tt>run</tt></b> command, you will probably get a trivial
    solution such as this one:</p>

<p>    <IMG SRC="trivial.png" BORDER=0>

<p> We can enforce some degree of non-triviality by adding the
    following line to the <b><tt>example</tt></b> function (uncomment
    it). </p>

<b><pre>
  all f: FSObject | some fs: FileSystem | f in fs.objects
</pre></b>

<p> Now you'll get something that is pleasantly non-trivial.
    Initially, you will get an ugly mess of lines and nodes. We can
    clean this up by projecting the result to the FileSystem object.</p>
    

<p> Now we will see a nice non-trivial example such as this one: </p>
