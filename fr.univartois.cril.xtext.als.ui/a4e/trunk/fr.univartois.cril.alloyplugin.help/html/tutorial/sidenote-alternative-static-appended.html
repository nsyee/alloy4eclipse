    <h2>Alternatives to "static" and appended facts</h2>

In <i>File System Lesson I</i>, we wrote

<b><pre>
  </b><i>// There exists a root</i><b>
  one sig Root extends Dir {
  }{
    no parent
  }
</b></pre>

Equivalently, we could have accomplished the same effect by writing
two additional facts:

<b><pre>
  </b><i>//Root is a kind of directory</i><b>
  sig Root extends Dir {}

  </b><i>//there is exactly one Root directory
  //(same effect as making Root "static")</i><b>
  fact oneRoot {
    one Root
  }

  </b><i>//Root has no parent
  //(same effect as the appended fact}</i><b>
  fact noParentOfRoot
    no Root.parent
  }
</b></pre>

<p> We could also combine those two <tt><b>fact</b></tt> statements
    into one.  Notice that when more than one constraint appears in a
    fact, they are separated by commas.

<b><pre>
  </b><i>//Root is a kind of directory</i><b>
  sig Root extends Dir {}

  </b><i>//there is exactly one Root directory
  //Root has no parent</i><b>
  fact oneRoot {
    one Root,
    no Root.parent
  }
</b></pre>

<p> We could also reword the second constraint in the fact (although
    there is no particular reason to do so) as follows:

<b><pre>
  </b><i>//Root is a kind of directory</i><b>
  sig Root extends Dir {}

  </b><i>//there is exactly one Root directory
  //Root has no parent</i><b>
  fact oneRoot {
    one Root,
    all r:Root | no r.parent
  }
</b></pre>

<p> this rewriting works because "<b><tt>.</tt></b>" gets mapped onto
    the elements of a set it is applies to.
    <!-- [link to sidenote about how that works] -->

<p> Both of these syntatic shorthands can make a model more concise
    and clearer, but are not always appropriate.  When and how you use
    them is a matter of style.
