    <h2><i>River Crossing Puzzle</i>: Solution</h2>

<p> The man first takes the chicken across, leaving it on the other
    side.  He returns alone in the canoe and picks up the bag of
    grain.  After bringing across the grain, he takes the chicken back
    to the original side, dropping him off, and picking up the fox.
    After bringing the fox to the other side, and leaving it with the
    grain, the man returns back to the original side, retrieving the
    chicken, and making his 3rd and final trip crossing the river.  At
    no point was the fox left alone with the chicken, nor the chicken
    with the grain.

    These last two sites discuss using such logic puzzles in
    interviews.  The first is a list of questions often used, with the
    intention of helping you to (dishonestly) thwart their use when
    you are interviewed.  The second one is a thoughtful analysis of
    how to do use them well if you are conducting the interview.
