<p> <a href="http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/alloy/"
    target="new"><i>Alloy</i></a> is a lightweight modelling language
    for software design. It is amenable to a fully automatic analysis,
    using the Alloy Analyzer, and provides a visualizer for making
    sense of solutions and counterexamples it finds.

<p> This introduction to <i>Alloy 3.0</i> includes:
<ul>
<li> a <b>tutorial</b> for writing declarative models in <i>Alloy</i> </li>
<li> a <b>walkthrough</b> of the <i>Alloy</i> interface and visualizer </li>
<li> tips and techniques to help you with the <b>modeling process</b> </li>
<li> two thoroughly explained <b>sample models</b> which are developed
     as running examples </li>
<li> A thorough list of <b>differences from version 2.0</b> </li>
</ul>

<p> This tutorial does not:
<ul>
<li> provide an <b>exhaustive list</b> of <i>Alloy</i> commands,
     although many are described in sidenotes;
<li> focus on the <b>technical semantics</b> of <i>Alloy</i>, although
     we do touch upon it in several sidenotes.  Rather, we focus on
     getting you to a point where you can read, write, and analyze
     reasonably advanced models;
<li> give a lengthy description of the <b>background philosophy</b>
     behind modeling and declarative modeling.  Chapter 0 gives a
     summary of these issues, but the focus of this tutorial is to
     teach <i>Alloy</i> not convincing you to use it.
</ul>

<p> For these things, consult the new <a href="manual.pdf"
   target="new">reference manual</a>. </p>

<h2>Instructions for using this tutorial</h2>

<p> The main text of the tutorial will appear in this frame of the
    window.  We will use running sample models, displayed in the <a
    href="currentmodel-intro.html" target="currentmodel"> top-right
    frame</a>.  Most links appearing in the body of the tutorial <a
    href="sidenote-intro.html" target="sidenote"> load sidenotes</a>
    into the bottom-right frame.  Sidenotes provide supplemental
    information and can be skipped without impeding your
    understanding of the current model.

<p> You are <i>not</i> expected to take this tutorial with
    <i>Alloy</i> open.  When you reach the <a
    href="currentmodel-walkthrough.html"
    onClick="window.self.location='maintext-walkthrough.html'"
    target="currentmodel"> <i>Alloy</i> walkthrough</a> (between
    Lessons I and II of Chapter 1), you will be instructed on how to
    use the <i>Alloy</i> interface.  After that point, you may choose
    to try out the things you see.  While doing so is certainly
    helpful, it is not required for understanding the tutorial.


<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>The Chapters (start here)</h2>

<ul>
<p> <a href="maintext-changes.html">Alloy 3.0 is slightly different
    from Alloy 2.0</a>, although the core concepts and modeling
    techniques are the same. This brief section will discuss changes
    in syntax, the new type system, and show how to upgrade a 2.0
    model to work under 3.0.  Alloy 3.0 also has vastly improved tools
    for visualizing solutions, which is covered in the walkthrough.

<li><a href="currentmodel-default.html"
     onClick="window.self.location='maintext-FS-0.html'"
     target="currentmodel"> Chapter 0</a>, gives background for
     declarative modeling, compares Alloy to its alternatives, and
     further introduces the tutorial.

<li> <a href="currentmodel-FS-I.html"
     onClick="window.self.location='maintext-FS-I.html'"
     target="currentmodel"> Chapter 1</a>, follows the development and
     analysis of a simple <i>Alloy</i> model of a file system, This
     chapter includes an <a href="currentmodel-walkthrough.html"
     onClick="window.self.location='maintext-walkthrough.html'"
     target="currentmodel"> <i>Alloy</i> interface walkthrough</a>
     between Lessons I and II.  This will also introduce you to Alloy
     3.0's improved solution visualizer.

<li> <a href="currentmodel-RC-I.html"
     onClick="window.self.location='maintext-RC-I.html'"
     target="currentmodel"> Chapter 2</a>, examines a more advanced
     <i>Alloy</i> model which solves the famous <a
     href="sidenote-RC-puzzle.html" target="sidenote"> River
     Crossing</a> planning problem, using the
     <b><tt>Ord</b></tt> package for modeling ordered state.
</ul>

<h3> Important Sidenotes</h3>

<p> Browse these after working through the chapters.  They stand on
    their own, but are not a gentle introduction to <i>Alloy</i> (the
    way the Chapters are).
<ul>
<li> <a href="sidenote-levels-of-understanding.html"
target="sidenote"> How <i>Alloy</i> works from the user's
perspective</a>.
<li> <A href="sidenote-relations-everywhere.html" target="sidenote">
How <i>Alloy</i> works behind the scenes</a>.
</ul>

<h3> List of All Sidenotes</h3>

<p> If you know just what you want, you can browse the <a
    href="sidenote-all.html" target="sidenote">complete list of all
    the sidenotes</a>, organized roughly by topic.  This is a terrible
    way to learn Alloy, but can be a useful Reference and can help
    fill in the cracks in your knowledge.

<h2>Getting Additional Help</h2>

<p> You can get more detailed information about <i>Alloy</i> syntax,
    patterns, and case studies from <a href =
    "http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10928">Software
    Abstraction</a>, a book by Daniel Jackson.  You can read some of
    the <a href="" target="new"> excerpts relevant to learning
    <i>Alloy</i></a>, or buy the book from <a
    href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> once it comes out.

    <i>Alloy</i> itself can be downloaded (for free) from the <a
    href="http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/alloy/" target="alloy"><i>Alloy</i>
    Home page</a>.

    tutorial, about <i>Alloy</i> in general, or about related
    research) to the <i>Alloy</i> mailing list,
