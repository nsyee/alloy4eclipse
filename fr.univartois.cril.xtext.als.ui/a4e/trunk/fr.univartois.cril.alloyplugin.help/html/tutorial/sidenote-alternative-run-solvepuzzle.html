    <h2>Alternate ways to run <b><tt>solvePuzzle</b></tt></h2>

<p> The following <b><tt>run</b></tt> command

<b><pre>
  run solvePuzzle for 4 Object, 8 State
</pre></b>

<p> could just as well have been written

<b><pre>
  run solvePuzzle for 4 but 8 State
</pre></b>

<p> or even

<b><pre>
  run solvePuzzle for 8 but 4 Object
</pre></b>

<p> In our case, however, the first of the 3 versions is probably the clearest, but one can imagine a case in which it would be much preferable to write

<b><pre>
  run solvePuzzle for 8 but 4 Object</b></tt>
</b></pre>

<p> rather than the longer, less clear, and more error prone

<b><pre>
  run solvePuzzle for 4 Object, 8 State, 8 foo,
      8 bar, 8 cuz, 8 quux, 8 fibbles, 8 thingy,
      8 majig, 8 floop, 8 whack, 8 blam, 8 pow
</b></pre>
