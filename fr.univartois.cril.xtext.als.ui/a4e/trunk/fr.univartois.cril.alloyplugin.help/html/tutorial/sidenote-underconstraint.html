    <h2>Underconstraint - a great win of declarative modeling</h2>

<p> When you haven't written enough constraints, and are allow absurd
    solutions which shouldn't even be considered, then you are facing
    a problem of underconsrtaint.  This kind of bug is actually pretty
    easy to catch.  You'll spot it when you get a bogus
    counterexample; one that shouldn't exist at all, and thus isn't a
    legitimate counterexample.  Look at it and formulate <i>why</i> it
    is ill-formed, then simply add a constraint to prevent solutions
    of that form.  However, make sure that the situation can't
    actually occur in the system you are modeling, and be wary of
    ruling out desirable solutions in your effort to prevent the bad
    one that you have found.
