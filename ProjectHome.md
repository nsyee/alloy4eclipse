The aim of this project is to allow the specification and analysis of models in the Alloy4 language on the Eclipse platform.

Check out the [Main Features](Tutorial.md) for details on current and upcoming features of the plugin.

This plugin was developed by Antoine Bourre and Francois Blarel, students from [Artois University](http://www.univ-artois.fr/), as a 4th year university project from January to May 2007, under the supervision of [Daniel Le Berre](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~leberre/). The plugin is maintained by [CRIL](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/).
Romuald Druelle and Lionel Desruelles continued the development of the plugin from January to April 2008.

In spring 2010, Mohamed Bouragba and Mohamed Said started a complete rewrite of the plugin using [Xtext technology](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/), in order to provide an Alloy 4 IDE more integrated within Eclipse. In spring 2011, Maxime Kapusta and Yoann Vasseur continued the development of the plugin to make the first Xtext based release (0.3.0) available by June 2011.

Some icons in the outline view are coming from the other Eclipse plugin for alloy [Alloy On Eclipse](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alloyoneclipse/).
